abstract = {Recently, Abebe et al. (KDD 2018) and Chan et al. (WWW 2019) have considered 
an opinion dynamics optimization problem that is based on a popular model for social opinion 
dynamics, in which each agent has some fixed innate opinion, and a resistance that measures 
the importance it places on its innate opinion; moreover, the agents influence one another’s 
opinions through an iterative process. Under certain conditions, this iterative process converges 
to some equilibrium opinion vector. Previous works gave an efficient local search algorithm to 
solve the unbudgeted variant of the problem, for which the goal is to modify the resistance of 
any number of agents (within some given range) such that the sum of the equilibrium opinions is 
minimized. On the other hand, it was proved that the \( L_0 \)-budgeted variant is NP-hard, where the 
\( L_0 \)-budget is a restriction given upfront on the number of agents whose resistance may be modified.
</p><p>
Inspired by practical situations in which the effort to modify an agent’s resistance increases with 
the magnitude of the change, we propose the \( L_1 \)-budgeted variant, in which the \( L_1 \)-budget is a 
restriction on the sum of the magnitudes of the changes over all agents’ resistance parameters. 
In this work, we show that the \( L_1 \)-budgeted variant is NP-hard via a reduction from the vertex 
cover problem. However, contrary to the \( L_0 \)-budgeted variant, a very technical argument is needed 
to show that the optimal solution can be achieved by focusing the given \( L_1 \)-budget on as small a 
number of agents as possible, as opposed to spreading the budget over a large number of agents.},

abstract = {Sampling without replacement is a natural online rounding strategy for 
converting fractional bipartite matching into an integral one. In Online Bipartite 
Matching, we can use the Balance algorithm to fractionally match each online vertex, 
and then sample an unmatched offline neighbor with probability proportional to the 
fractional matching. In Online Stochastic Matching, we can take the solution to a 
linear program relaxation as a reference, and then match each online vertex to an 
unmatched offline neighbor with probability proportional to the fractional matching 
of the online vertex's type. On the one hand, we find empirical evidence that online 
matching algorithms based on sampling without replacement outperform existing algorithms. 
On the other hand, the literature offers little theoretical understanding of the power 
of sampling without replacement in online matching problems.
</p><p>
This paper fills the gap in the literature by giving the first non-trivial competitive 
analyses of sampling without replacement for online matching problems. In Online Stochastic 
Matching, we develop a potential function analysis framework to show that sampling without 
replacement is at least \( 0.707 \)-competitive. The new analysis framework further allows us to 
derandomize the algorithm to obtain the first polynomial-time deterministic algorithm that 
breaks the \( 1-1/e \) barrier. In Online Bipartite Matching, we show that sampling without 
replacement provides provable online correlated selection guarantees when the selection 
probabilities correspond to the fractional matching chosen by the Balance algorithm. 
As a result, we prove that sampling without replacement is at least \( 0.513 \)-competitive 
for Online Bipartite Matching.},
