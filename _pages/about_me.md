I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Information Systems, Business Statistics and Operations Management at the Hong Kong University of Sciencd and Technology, where jointly mentored by [Guodong Lyu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UMzOfhgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yiding Feng](https://www.ydfeng.us/). I completed my PhD at the University of Hong Kong, where I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Zhiyi Huang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/). I also earned my Bachelor degree in Computing and Data Analytics from the Univeresity of Hong Kong, where I was advised by [T.-H. Hubert Chan](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~hubert/) and [Zhiwen Zhang](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~zhangzw/). During the COVID-19 pandemic, I co-authored an educational storybook on fair division for secondary school students with [Ka Ho Law](https://hkumath.hku.hk/MathWWW/people.php?faculty.lawkaho). 

My research interests lie in online algorithms and fair allocation, with a growing interest in robust decision-making under uncertainty.
