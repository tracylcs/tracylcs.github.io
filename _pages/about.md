I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Information Systems, Business Statistics and Operations Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, jointly mentored by [Prof. Guodong Lyu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UMzOfhgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Yiding Feng](https://www.ydfeng.us/). I completed my PhD at the University of Hong Kong, where I was very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Zhiyi Huang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/). I also earned my Bachelor's degree in Computing and Data Analytics from the University of Hong Kong, where I was advised by [Prof. T.-H. Hubert Chan](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~hubert/) and [Prof. Zhiwen Zhang](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~zhangzw/). 

My research interests lie in online algorithms and fair allocation, with a growing interest in robust decision-making under uncertainty. I have also been fascinated by algorithmic game theory. See the [educational storybook on fair division](https://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/tc/curriculum-development/kla/ma/res/Cabinet27.pdf) which I co-authored with [Dr. Ka Ho Law](https://hkumath.hku.hk/MathWWW/people.php?faculty.lawkaho) during my undergraduate career.
